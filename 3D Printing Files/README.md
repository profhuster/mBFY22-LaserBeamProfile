There are two objects to 3D print here, the case and the translation stage.
- `S2Mini_Stepper_22a.scad` is the case
- `S2Mini_Stepper_22a_both.stl` has the top and bottom laid out and ready to print.
- `MotorizedPrecisionTranslationStage 22b.scad` the source code for the translation stage.
- `MotorizedPrecisionTranslationStage 22b.stl` the ready to print file.

I modified the translation stage after the mBFY workshop because the drive 
screw would bind in the clearance holes for it and stall the motor. 
Version `22b` I hope is a fix. The first clearance hole is slightly larger, 
and the second hole is lengthened in the vertical direction and has a vertical 
slot for the hex nut instead of a hex nut capture depression.
