There are two objects to 3D print here, the case and the translation stage.

I modified the translation stage after the mBFY workshop because the drive 
screw would bind in the clearance holes for it and stall the motor. 
Version `22b` I hop is a fix. The first clearance hole is slightly larger, 
and the second hole is lenghtened in the vertical direction and has a vertical 
slot for the hex nut instead of a hex nut capture depression.
